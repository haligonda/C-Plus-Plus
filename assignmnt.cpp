/*
 * C++ Assignment Operators Examples
 * =================================
 * 
 * This file demonstrates various assignment operators in C++:
 * - Arithmetic assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
 * - Bitwise assignment operators (&=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=)
 * 
 * Key Concept: Assignment operators modify a variable and assign the result
 * back to the same variable. For example: x += 5 is equivalent to x = x + 5

     * Key Learning Points:
     * 
     * 1. Assignment operators provide shorthand for common operations
     * 2. x += 5 is more concise than x = x + 5
     * 3. Arithmetic operators: +=, -=, *=, /=, %= work with numbers
     * 4. Bitwise operators: &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>= work with binary bits
     * 5. Shift operators are efficient ways to multiply/divide by powers of 2
     * 6. All these operators modify the original variable
     * 
     * Note: In this example, functions use pass-by-value, so the original
     * variable 'x' in main() doesn't change. To modify the original,
     * we'd need pass-by-reference (int &x).
