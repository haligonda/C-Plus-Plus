/*
 * C++ Recursion Examples
 * ======================
 * 
 * This file demonstrates recursion concepts in C++:
 * - What recursion is and how it works
 * - Base cases and recursive cases
 * - How the call stack works with recursive functions
 * - Common recursive problems and their solutions
 * 
 * Key Concept: Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve
 * a smaller version of the same problem. It's like mathematical induction -
 * solve the base case, then show how to get from one step to the next.

/*
 * Function: sum (Recursive)
 * Purpose: Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to x
 * Parameter: int x - The number to sum up to
 * Returns: int - The sum of all numbers from 1 to x
 * 
 * Mathematical formula: sum(x) = x + (x-1) + (x-2) + ... + 2 + 1
 * Recursive formula: sum(x) = x + sum(x-1)
 * 
 * Example: sum(5) = 5 + sum(4) = 5 + 4 + sum(3) = 5 + 4 + 3 + sum(2) = ...
 *          = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15

     * where the function stops calling itself and returns a value.
     * Without a base case, the function would call itself infinitely
     * and cause a stack overflow.

     * Base case: When x <= 0, return 0 (sum of nothing is 0)

     * Key Learning Points:
     * 
     * 1. Components of Recursion:
     *    - Base case: Condition where recursion stops
     *    - Recursive case: Function calls itself with smaller problem
     *    - Progress toward base case: Problem must get "smaller" each time
     * 
     * 2. How Recursion Works:
     *    - Each function call is added to the call stack
     *    - When base case is reached, functions start returning
     *    - Results bubble back up through the stack
     * 
     * 3. Advantages of Recursion:
     *    - Clean, readable code for naturally recursive problems
     *    - Mirrors mathematical definitions (factorial, Fibonacci)
     *    - Elegant solutions for tree/graph traversal
     *    - Natural fit for divide-and-conquer algorithms
     * 
     * 4. Disadvantages of Recursion:
     *    - Can be slower than iterative solutions (function call overhead)
     *    - Uses more memory (call stack grows)
     *    - Risk of stack overflow with deep recursion
     *    - Can be harder to debug
     * 
     * 5. When to Use Recursion:
     *    - Problem has recursive structure (trees, graphs)
     *    - Mathematical sequences (factorial, Fibonacci)
     *    - Divide-and-conquer algorithms (merge sort, quick sort)
     *    - Parsing nested structures (JSON, XML)
     *    - Backtracking problems (maze solving, N-queens)
     * 
     * 6. Common Pitfalls:
     *    - Forgetting the base case (infinite recursion)
     *    - Base case that's never reached
     *    - Not making progress toward base case
     *    - Inefficient recursion (like naive Fibonacci)
     * 
     * 7. Optimization Tips:
     *    - Use memoization to cache results
     *    - Consider iterative alternatives for simple cases
     *    - Tail recursion optimization (where supported)
     *    - Set reasonable recursion depth limits
