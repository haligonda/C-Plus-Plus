/*
 * POINTERS IN C++ 👉
 * 
 * This program teaches you:
 * 1. What pointers are and why they're useful
 * 2. How to create and use pointers
 * 3. The difference between addresses and values
 * 4. Dereferencing pointers to access values
 * 5. Different ways to work with pointer syntax
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Pointer: A variable that stores a memory address
 * - Address (&): Where a variable is stored in memory
 * - Dereference (*): Access the value at the address
 * - Memory: Computer storage where variables are kept
 * 
 * Think of it like this:
 * - Variable = House with an address
 * - Pointer = Paper with the house address written on it
 * - Dereferencing = Going to that address to see what's inside

    // =========================================================
    cout << "📊 STEP 2: Accessing the Variable's Value" << endl;
    cout << "   Direct access: personName = " << personName << endl;
    cout << "   💡 This gives us the actual content of the variable" << endl;

    // STEP 3: Create a pointer to the variable
    // =========================================================
    cout << "📊 STEP 3: Creating a Pointer" << endl;
    cout << "   A pointer stores the MEMORY ADDRESS of another variable" << endl;
