/*
 * CLASS METHODS IN C++ ‚öôÔ∏è
 * 
 * This program teaches you:
 * 1. What class methods (member functions) are
 * 2. How to define methods inside and outside the class
 * 3. How methods can access and modify member variables
 * 4. The difference between data and behavior in classes
 * 5. How to call methods on objects
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Method: A function that belongs to a class (also called member function)
 * - Member variables: Data that belongs to each object
 * - Member functions: Behavior/actions that objects can perform
 * - this: An implicit pointer to the current object
 * - Encapsulation: Combining data and methods that work on that data
 * 
 * Think of methods like this:
 * - A car (object) has properties: brand, model, speed
 * - A car can also DO things: start(), accelerate(), brake()
 * - Methods are the actions an object can perform
