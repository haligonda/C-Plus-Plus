/*
 * CLASS CONSTRUCTORS IN C++ üèóÔ∏è
 * 
 * This program teaches you:
 * 1. What classes are and how they differ from structs
 * 2. What constructors are and why they're important
 * 3. How to create and use constructors
 * 4. Public vs private access in classes
 * 5. How to create objects using constructors
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - class: A blueprint for creating objects (like a template)
 * - Constructor: A special function that runs when an object is created
 * - Object: An instance of a class (like a car made from car blueprint)
 * - public: Members accessible from outside the class
 * - private: Members only accessible from inside the class
 * - Member variables: Variables that belong to the class
 * - Member functions: Functions that belong to the class
 * 
 * Think of a class like a cookie cutter:
 * - The class is the cookie cutter (template)
 * - Objects are the cookies (individual instances)
 * - Constructor is the process of cutting the cookie
